Although she once distrusted humans, meeting many kind people gradually helps her overcome those feelings. Sincere and pure at heart, she loves nature and humanity, despising conflict. For a time she lives in hiding in the Forest of Demons after an elderly human couple takes her in. Johnny then asks her to join the Jellyfish Pirates, where she is welcomed warmly. During this new peaceful life, she meets Ky Kiske, a director of the International Police Force at the time, and falls in love. She eventually bears him a son, Sin. Later, she is sealed away in slumber to escape an enemy attack and subsequently freed during the Cradle incident. After Ky steps down from his position as Allied King of Illyria, Dizzy now rules the new kingdom Vialattea together with him. Although still growing accustomed to her official duties, she finds each day fulfilling.",

There is a rigidity to his speech that suggests he favors reason above all else, but in fact, he places high importance on emotion, empathy, and humility. During the battle with Bedman, the leader of the Assassin‚Äôs Guild Venom dies‚Äìto the outside world, at least. After Robo-Ky saves his life, he attempts to fund his repairs by taking any work he can get, until Zato gifts him ownership of the store where he opens his bakery. Through his new life as a baker, Venom learns of a new and unfamiliar ‚Äúbattle.‚Äù He grows fond of the townspeople who fight not to take the lives of others but for their own pride, and swears to protect their ‚Äúbattlefield.‚Äù And so begins his new battle: baker by day, mysterious punisher ‚ÄúPhantom‚Äù by night.",
